# Discovering FastAPI

I've been going through TalkPython course [Modern APIs with FastAPI and Python Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/getting-started-with-fastapi)

## Useful links:

- No better place than [**FastAPI documentation**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [**httpstatuses**](https://httpstatuses.com/): I love this website, it's like the best cheatsheet you can find on the web for status codes
